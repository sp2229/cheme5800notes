Argument types in julia help it distinguish Fibonacci for loop vs./ while loop

Push bang has million of versions and is able to match the argument type to the function

Create an empty model, set values, 

make a factory build method to get default values for parameters 


Factory Method 
Mutations: 
Set default method for computation 
Mutation effect got data 
need to say return to get data out of a function 
fibonacci! (mutation) executed at last line, \

Julia function does mutate its domain 

A named tuple is a list with names, like a dictionary, but immutable
