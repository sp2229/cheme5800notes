# GitHub Classroom Troubleshooting Guide

## Common "Invalid Invitation" Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Expired Invitation Link
**Problem**: The GitHub Classroom invitation link has expired
**Solution**: Contact your instructor for a new invitation link

### Issue 2: Wrong GitHub Account
**Problem**: You're logged into the wrong GitHub account
**Solutions**:
- Log out of GitHub and log in with the correct account
- Check that your GitHub username matches what you provided to the instructor

### Issue 3: Browser/Cache Issues
**Problem**: Browser cache or cookies are interfering
**Solutions**:
- Clear your browser cache and cookies
- Try using an incognito/private browsing window
- Try a different browser

### Issue 4: Repository Access Confusion
**Problem**: Trying to access the wrong repository
**Clarification**:
- **Course Notes**: `sp2229/cheme5800notes` (this repository) - for reference materials
- **Lab Assignments**: `CHEME-5800-Labs-Fall-2025` - accessed via GitHub Classroom invitation

### Issue 5: Account Permissions
**Problem**: Your GitHub account doesn't have the necessary permissions
**Solutions**:
- Verify your GitHub account is the one the instructor expects
- Check if your account needs to be added to the course organization
- Ensure your account email matches your institutional email

## Step-by-Step Invitation Process

1. **Receive invitation link** from instructor (usually via email or course platform)
2. **Click the link** while logged into your GitHub account
3. **Accept the assignment** in GitHub Classroom
4. **Wait for repository creation** (this may take a few minutes)
5. **Clone the created repository** to your local machine

## If You're Still Having Issues

Contact your instructor with the following information:
- Your GitHub username
- The exact error message you're seeing
- A screenshot of the error (if possible)
- The invitation link you're trying to use
- Whether you can access GitHub normally for other repositories

## Quick Verification Steps

Before contacting support, try these quick checks:

1. ✅ Are you logged into GitHub?
2. ✅ Is this the correct GitHub account?
3. ✅ Can you access other GitHub repositories normally?
4. ✅ Are you using the most recent invitation link?
5. ✅ Have you tried clearing your browser cache?

If all checks pass and you're still having issues, the problem is likely on the instructor/course setup side.
