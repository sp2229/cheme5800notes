To convert a character into numbers: 
bit_pattern_array = bitstring(xâ‚’) |> collect |> reverse .|> x-> parse(Int,x) # This is a magical line!

Object, string, etc. made an integer using a hash

Computers use binary (base=2) because computers can only operate at high or low voltage. 
Advantages of binary is exactness
In floating point world, decimal points show fixed precision and it is lost 
Float (16) is less precise than float (64)
Example: pi is not an infinite length, determined by float length
