Graphs and Trees: 
- Model decision processes, social networks, etc. 


Simple Graph has V vertices and E edges
Each pair of vertices has one edge between them and no sel-loops
Directed: specific direction (person A follows B, but B does not follow A) 
    Degree: number of edges associated with a node in an undirected graph G (edges connected to the node, no direction necessary)
    w13 index (1 is node coming from and 3 is node going to)
Undirected: no direction 
    In-Degree: number of edges into a node in a directed graph G
    Out-Degree: number of connections going out (directional edges)
Connected: At least 1 path between vertices i and j

Vertex Degree 

The degree of a vertex X in a graph H 

In-degree + Out degree = total degree
Handshaking Lemma: Sum of all degrees of vertex is equal to twice the number of edges 

Average Degree: 2*Edges / vertex
GraphDensity: 2*Edges / (n*(n-1))
Regular Graphs: regular if every vertex has the same degree r for all vertex 

Graph G=(V,E)
Adjacency Matrix A: represents entry row for i,j
    --> Does not tell you wether a graph is directed/undirected 
    --> High Density (lots of nonzero elements)
    --> High memory (matrix is vertices ^2 * 8 bytes )
    --> Ways around this: do not need to store all vertices, only store non-zero elements 
    --> Adjacency List: Store the index of the node and that will be a key that can point to a value that is the connections of that node, does not reveal weight of the connections (V+E size)
    --> Adjacency Matrix has size (V^2)
Unweighted graph: if an edge connected node i to node j, a(ij)=1

Complete graph: simple and undirected graph where every vertice is connected by an edge

Graphs that you can use to model the relationships between people in a friend group, classifying data in a matching between two sets 
Negative relationship: cause problems, specialized algorithms required 

Bipartite graph: check to see with coloring 

Matching problems: model scenarios where something has ot be matched 
Network Flow: Supply chain model 
Biological: social and genes that regulate protein expression 


Hall's Marriage Theorem: Enough choices for everyone to find a match
