# CHEME 5800 Course Notes

This repository contains course notes and documentation for CHEME 5800.

## Important: Repository Purpose

**This repository (`cheme5800notes`) is for course notes and reference materials only.**

For lab assignments and problem sets, you need to access the **GitHub Classroom** for the course labs.

## Accessing GitHub Classroom for Labs

### If you're having trouble with an "invalid invitation" error:

1. **Check the invitation link**: Make sure you're using the correct GitHub Classroom invitation link provided by your instructor
2. **Verify your GitHub account**: Ensure you're logged into the correct GitHub account
3. **Check timing**: Classroom invitations may have expiration dates
4. **Contact your instructor**: If the invitation appears invalid, contact your instructor for a new link

### Expected Repository Structure for Labs

According to the setup instructions in `sofia/OpeningJulia_Server _for_VS.m`, lab work should be done in a repository with this structure:

```
CHEME-5800-Labs-Fall-2025/
└── labs/
    ├── week-1/
    │   └── L1b/
    └── week-2/
        └── ...
```

### Setup Instructions for Labs

Once you have access to the correct lab repository through GitHub Classroom:

1. Clone the lab repository (not this notes repository)
2. Follow the Julia setup instructions in `sofia/OpeningJulia_Server _for_VS.m`
3. Navigate to the specific lab directory (e.g., `labs/week-1/L1b`)
4. Run Julia with the project environment: `julia --project=.`

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid invitation" errors:

- **Double-check the URL**: Ensure you're clicking the correct GitHub Classroom link
- **Clear browser cache**: Sometimes cached data can cause issues
- **Try incognito/private browsing**: This can help with authentication issues
- **Verify account access**: Make sure your GitHub account has the necessary permissions

### Repository confusion:

- **Notes repository** (this one): `sp2229/cheme5800notes` - for course notes and documentation
- **Lab repository**: `CHEME-5800-Labs-Fall-2025` - accessed through GitHub Classroom invitation
