- Classical Hopfield networks used Hebbian learning that memorizes binary patterns 
    - Limited to being used in large data 
    - Limited to binary patterns 
- Embedding is converting to a continuous vector

Modern Hopfield Networks and Signle-Head Attention 
- Exponentially larger storage capacity 
- Attention mechanism is how the system recognizes one memory vs. another 
    - Bridges associative memory with modern deep learning
- Remember many patterns with continuous values and have higher conversion
- Modern E(s) = ∑ F(m,s) from i = 1 to i = K number of memories
    - F(m,s) is similarity function
    - Similarity is the dot product --> high dot product means very similar, low dot product if not similar
